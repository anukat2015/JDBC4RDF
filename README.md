# JDBC4RDF

## Introduction

This project implements various mappings for RDF data to relational 
data using JDBC. This will include the import of data and execution 
of SPARQL queries.
The Data Import and Query Execution are based on the Sempala and 
S2RDF benchmarks.


## Data Import

RDF data will be mapped to triple-tables, VP and extVP

## Query Execution 

SPARQL queries will be translated to SQL and executed
